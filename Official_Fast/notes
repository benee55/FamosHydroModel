Notes 

6/18
- Posterior from 1000k iter=8 cycle=6 run are very rough. 
- Are particles mutating properly? 
- Should we just temper 10% at a time? 
-- Big jump is from cycle 3 to 4 and cycle 4 to 5 
--- Tempered values are 19.6 and 23.7 respectively 

6/19
1. Began runs where variance is fixed at posterior estimates from the first official run var=

Possible Computer Experiments:
1. Try rescaling parameters so that the proposals for MCMC lead to faster mixing
2. Fix variance at 2000?
3. Adjust tempering schedule?
